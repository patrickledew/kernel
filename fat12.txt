READING A FAT12 ENTRY

On disk, pairs of FAT12 entries can be read as a single 24-bit number (3 bytes)
If we refer to the first byte as byte A, second as byte B, and third as byte C:

Low 8 bits of entry 1 = byte A
High 4 bits of entry 1 = low nibble of byte B

Low 4 bits of entry 2 = high nibble of byte B
High 8 bits of entry 2 = byte C

e.g. for block AA Bb CC, constructed value for 1 would be 0bAA, 2 would be 0CCB
