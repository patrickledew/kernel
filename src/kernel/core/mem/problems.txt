Currently, i'm running into the problem of strings still using their absolute addresses.
This means that once we zap the identity PD entry, those addresses wont make sense

Either we need to figure out some linker magic, or we're gonna be rebuilding the boot
process to initialize virtual memory before we execute any of the main kernel code.

Another way is to manually add the kernel offset to any strings we use but...ew.

I honestly think the way to go is to:

A. link kernel.elf so it starts at virtual address 0xc0000000
B. extend the boot assembly to setup vmem, and only jump to kmain once that's done.
